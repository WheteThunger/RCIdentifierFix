This plugin fixes a vanilla Rust issue where if an RC entity (such as a CCTV camera or drone) is destroyed, placing a new one and reusing the same identifier doesn't allow you to use it in computer stations where you had already saved that identifier, unless you remove it from the computer station and add it back, which is annoying. With this plugin, the computer station will automatically find the current entity matching the saved identifier, saving you some time.
